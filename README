Play it slowly Manual
=====================

About
=====
'Play it slowly' is a tool to help you when transcribing music.
It allows you to play a piece of music at a different speed or pitch.

Generic Installation
====================
To install use you need to have the following libraries installed:

 * Python 2.5
 * PyGTK >= 2.10
 * PyGST >= 0.10
 * gstreamer including the soundtouch/pitch element

Normally these libraries are already installed on your system.

To install play it slowly execute: ``python setup.py install`` as 
superuser (root). If you are using a gnome based system like Ubuntu
you can just doubleclick ``install.sh`` and select run.

Distribution Specific Installation Hints
========================================

Arch Linux
----------
Arch Linux is missing the pitch element, so you'll have to compile
yourself::

    pacman -S soundtouch
    cd /tmp
    wget gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-bad/gst-plugins-bad-0.10.9.tar.gz
    tar xzf gst-plugins-bad-0.10.9.tar.gz
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    cd ext/soundtouch
    make && make install 

Then test if it worked::

    gst-inspect-0.10 soundtouch

Mandriva
--------
Install gstreamer0.10-soundtouch.

Ubuntu
------
It should work out of the box!
